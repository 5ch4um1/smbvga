these might be interesting i guess?


  50:	0x03 0x42 0x74 0x00
  51:	0x0a 0x0b 0xc5 0x0c 0x7a 0x0d 0x50 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x0f
  52:	0x08 0x01 0xfa 0xee 0x08 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x80
  53:	0x07 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x5f
  54:	0x0d 0x00 0x4b 0x00 0x00 0xc0 0x10 0x10 0x08 0x00 0x00 0x04 0x40 0x00


assuming that they still somehow stick to the specs,
i guess i should zero out these:

  50:	0x03 0x42
  51:	0x0a 0x0b
  52:	0x08 0x01
  53:	0x07 0x00

time to enter boot rom mode again?
because in what i thought would be full access mode, i won't let me write nothing...
or, ok, i also did not quite understand yet how to write stuff, so, a word write command
to an address obviously does not write that word, but rather executes a command...
the datasheet somehow suggets that you first specify the address you want to write to by writing to one address,
 and then issue the actual write command by writing to another, i guess i have to read some datasheets again...
or, simplified, if i want to write to address c, i first have to word write the address of c to b, then a write command + the 
data i want to write to a? using i2ctransfer? so, might 0x40 be that address a?
